# Project5-Data-processing-system


User just needed to copy both these file to a folder and open Project5.py using cmd or using any python ide.
It is to make sure, that both Project.py and db.py are in the same folder.
sqlite3 and Tkinter libraries must be installed in user's system in order to program to work



db.py file is to maintain database, there is defined a class named Database. In Database some basic function defined, which is used in maintaing data, like insert remove,update,search etc.
Project5.py file deals mainly with GUI application and calling db.py's class database and function. In starting some functions are defined which later used in the program, after that work of GUI application is done.
